    "You are a data analyst for The Recording Academy. I have analyzed website traffic, engagement metrics, and age demographics for Grammys.com and RecordingAcademy.com both before and after the site split. Using all these findings, write a clear business memo summarizing the key insights, including when traffic spikes occur, how engagement metrics like pages per session, bounce rate, and time on site changed after the split, and how the audience age demographics differ between the two websites. Based on the data, recommend whether The Recording Academy should keep the sites separate, merge them back together, or consider an alternative strategy. Provide 2–3 actionable suggestions to improve year-round engagement."

    "ChatGPT did a good job summarizing the main trends, including the traffic spikes around Award Night, how engagement metrics changed after the site split, and the differences in age demographics between the two websites. It captured the overall story clearly and highlighted the key insights in a concise way. However, the response was somewhat general at times and did not reference specific numeric values from my actual calculations, which made some points less precise. It also simplified a few findings, so some nuance—such as the exact size of the traffic difference between award nights vs regular nights—was missing. Overall, it provided a strong summary but needed more data-specific detail for full accuracy.\n"

    "To: Ray Starck and The Recording Academy Leadership Team\n",
    "From: Damierra-Joy Mbu Besong\n",
    "Subject: Web Performance Insights & Recommendation Following the Site Split\n",
    "\n",
    "After analyzing traffic, engagement, and demographic data for both Grammys.com and RecordingAcademy.com, several clear patterns emerged that help explain how users engage with each platform and how the 2022 site split has influenced performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, grammys.com continues to experience dramatic traffic surges around Award Night, where visitor volume increases several times higher than the daily average on regular days. Smaller spikes also appear leading up to the ceremony due to nomination announcements, performance reveals, and promotional campaigns. This confirms that the Grammys ceremony remains the core driver of web interest, while off-season traffic remains comparatively low.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, engagement metrics following the site split show signs of improvement. Pages per session remained steady or increased slightly, and bounce rates dropped on the music-facing site—indicating that visitors are finding more relevant content faster. Average time on site also remained strong. These trends suggest that separating fan-focused content (Grammys) from industry- and membership-focused content (Recording Academy) has helped streamline user pathways and improved the overall quality of engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Demographic data reinforces this separation: Grammys.com attracts a significantly younger audience, particularly within the 18–34 range, while RecordingAcademy.com draws a more mature audience with heavier concentration in the 35+ brackets. This aligns well with the intended purpose of each platform and supports the value of keeping them distinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these insights, I recommend keeping the two sites separate, while strengthening the year-round engagement strategy on Grammys.com and optimizing navigation across both platforms. To support this, I suggest:\n",
    "\t1.\tDevelop ongoing, evergreen fan content (editorials, playlists, short-form videos, performance archives) to reduce dependence on Awards Night spikes.\n",
    "\t2.\tImprove cross-site navigation and interlinking, guiding highly engaged Grammys visitors toward Recording Academy initiatives such as membership, advocacy, and programs.\n",
    "\t3.\tEnhance user experience with clearer content categories and stronger calls-to-action to continue reducing bounce rates and increasing pages per session.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the site split has improved content relevance and supported stronger user pathways. With a more intentional year-round content strategy, The Recording Academy can transform peak Award Night traffic into a sustained audience across both platforms."
